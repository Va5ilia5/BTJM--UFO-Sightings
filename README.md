# BTYM--UFO-Sightings

An increase in news articles, particularly on Unidentified Flying Objects, or UFOs. While we wait to comment, the Pentagon's UAP Task Force is anticipated to issue an unclassified version of the study sometime in late June 2021.

We will look at the steady increase of UFO sightings in USA and Canada from the data;

- date and time (1400 to 2021)
- comments on the UFO
- Shape of UFO
- Location

We will be looking at the optimum location, time, day and month to go UFO hunting.



### The following are some of the data techniques I used in the project:

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Wrangling
- Data Cleaning
- Data Mining
- Practical Statistics (i.e. applying inferential statistics and probability to real-world scenarios, like analyzing A/B tests.)
- SQL for Data Analysis
- Data Visualization to draw meaningful conclusions

### Technical Skills utilized
- Python
- Data Analysis/Wrangling libraries (Numpy, Pandas)
- Data Visualization libraries (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Microsoft Excel
- Jupyter Notebooks
- SQL
